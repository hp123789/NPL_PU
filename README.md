## TODO
- Fix the captions freezing after pressing `DONE`
- Think about idea of pie menu popping up on a certain neural click
- When hovering over a word on the caption, highlight it, and if clicked then replace it with next best word
- Remove `DONE` button, only needs to be shown when decoding begins
- Add commands such as new line, select word (that cursor is on), and any other key or keyboard shortcut.
  - Punctuation will be done automatically
- When `SPELL` is pressed, use spell mode once and automatically turn off
